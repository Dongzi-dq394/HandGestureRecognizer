# Recognition Models
Here are some models we trained and saved to local file, which can predict the gestures very well.

* Model 1 (saved_model.hdf5): Adapted from VGG16 with more linear layers and reaching almost 91% accuracy and almost 100% validation accuracy. Users can download this model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hymq_gz-HSY988HR3HdCplkbcf8RSDUZ/view?usp=sharing), and it's about 500MB.
* Model 2 (vgg16_hand_3.h5): VGG16 from scratch reaching  >90% accuracy and 99%+ validation accuracy. Users can download this model from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qmyknHnUM0VWRv6OwsQ0EGclrf31gxGp), and it's about 1.61GB.
